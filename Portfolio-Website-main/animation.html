            <div class="cont">
                <p><h4>Critical Section:</h4>The critical section refers to the part of the reservation process where conflicts can occur, such as when booking a specific seat or flight. To ensure mutual exclusion, this critical section must be properly protected.</p>
                <p> Without mutual exclusion, multiple users or processes can simultaneously attempt to book the same seat or flight. As a result, the system may allow more than one reservation for the same resource, leading to double bookings. This can cause significant inconvenience to passengers and result in overbooking situations.</p>
                <p>To achieve mutual exclusion, you can utilize a locking mechanism. Each shared resource, such as a seat or flight, should have an associated lock. The lock can be implemented as a binary flag or a data structure that indicates whether the resource is currently being accessed or modified by any user or process.</p>
